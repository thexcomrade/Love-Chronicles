# Love-Chronicles 💖 

This is a sweet, personalized web page built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to celebrate a special milestone in a relationship — like a 1-year anniversary. The template is dynamic and can be connected to a Python Flask backend to render personalized content such as names, photos, reasons for love, and a heartfelt letter.
