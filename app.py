To My Love,

From the moment we first met, something just felt like our souls already knew each other. I still remember that first time we sat together over a simple cup of tea, talking for hours like the rest of the world had disappeared. Since then, every moment with you has felt like both a heartbeat and a lifetime.

I often find myself thinking about the laughter weâ€™ve shared, the quiet moments in between, and the way you held my hand like it was the only thing that mattered. In those little moments, I realized I was falling in love with you completely, effortlessly, and deeply.

I want you to know that Iâ€™m here for you, always. I promise to:
 1. Make you smile, even when the days are heavy.
 2. Hold you close when you feel the weight of the world.
 3. Choose you, over and over, every dayâ€”with my whole heart.

Life wonâ€™t always be easy, but no matter what it brings, youâ€™ll never face it alone. Iâ€™ll be by your sideâ€”today, tomorrow, and for all the days to come.

With all my love,  
Your's (ABC) ðŸ§¸
